# CP-stuffs üöÄ

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming Repository**! This repo documents my journey in competitive programming **after graduating** (ü§£ Retiring ü§£) , where I continue to solve problems, refine my skills, explore new challenges and mostly have fun. It also serves as a collection of my solutions, tools, and resources for competitive programming.

## üèÜ Achievements

- **ICPC Certified**: I am proud to have participated in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), a prestigious competition that tests problem-solving skills under time pressure.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Current Environment Setup

I use the following tools to streamline my competitive programming workflow:

- **Primary Editor**: [Vscodium](https://vscodium.com/)
  The go-to editor for its flexibility and extensive plugin ecosystem.

- **Alternative Editors**:
  - **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)**: For lightweight and fast editing, especially when working in the terminal.
  - **[Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)**: A terminal file manager that I occasionally use for quick navigation and file management.

- **Extensions**:
  - [Competitive Companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion): Fetches problems directly into my editor.
  - [Competitive Programming Helper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper): Helps with testing and debugging.
  - [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner): Executes code snippets quickly.

- **Code Snippets**:
  You can find reusable code snippets in any solution file. These snippets are optimized for speed and efficiency.

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

- **File Names**:
  Files are named using the **Problem ID** for easy identification. For example, a problem from Codeforces with ID `123A` will be saved as `123A.cpp`.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repo

1. **Browse Solutions**:
   Navigate through the folders to find solutions to specific problems. Each file contains the problem ID and the corresponding solution.

2. **Reuse Code Snippets**:
   Feel free to reuse any code snippets or templates provided in the solution files.

3. **Contribute**:
   If you have a better solution or want to add a problem, feel free to open a pull request!

## üí° Why This Setup Works for Me

- **Efficiency**:
  The combination of VSCode, Competitive Companion, and Competitive Programming Helper allows me to fetch, test, and debug problems quickly.

- **Customizability**:
  VSCode's extensive plugin ecosystem lets me tailor the editor to my needs, from snippets to themes.

- **Tools**:
  I use my own [dotporter](https://crates.io/crates/dotporter) Rust tool to backup my configuration everytime i change my computer (just migrated from M1 pro to M4 pro).

- **Portability**:
  All my solutions and tools are stored in one place, making it easy to switch between devices or share my setup with others.

- **Learning**:
  By solving problems on multiple platforms, I get exposure to a wide variety of challenges and improve my problem-solving skills.

## üí° Tips for Competitive Programming

- **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key to improving problem-solving skills.
- **Learn Algorithms**: Focus on mastering essential algorithms and data structures.
- **Participate in Contests**: Join online contests to test your skills under time pressure.
- **Optimize Code**: Always look for ways to make your code faster and more efficient.
