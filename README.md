In this repo i'll be pushing all the problems that i'll be solving on different online judges for fun !

  

> After starting my full time work journey iIdid not find it easy to do CP challenges especially with the same rythme that i used to have back then when i was still undergraduate . So after struggling for a few years to keep up with the habit (constantly solving problems from different online judges), I had the idea of starting a Git repos to keep track of my progress ....

My current env setup for CP (I've been sticking to these tools for a while) : 

 - [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
 - [Competitive companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion) 
 - [Competitve programming helper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper)
 - [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)
 - Code Snippets can be found in any Solution File.

    
    


  


Online judges mostly used (along side with others):

-  [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)

-  [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
