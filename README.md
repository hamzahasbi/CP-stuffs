In this repo i'll be pushing all the problems that i'll be solving on different online judges for fun !



My current env setup for CP (I've been sticking to these tools for a while) :

 - [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [Competitive companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion)
 - [Competitve programming helper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper)
 - [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)
 - Code Snippets can be found in any Solution File.
